# SpoTUI


[![Live Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Preview-GitHub%20Pages-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://skensmaster.github.io/SpoTUI-Docs/)

SpoTUI is a terminal-inspired theme for Spotify that overlays a custom, keyboard-driven interface directly inside the Spotify client. It is built for [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/).

## How It Works

SpoTUI is a self-contained Spicetify theme that uses:
- **`theme.js`**: A vanilla JavaScript component that creates and manages the entire TUI, including panels, commands, and Spotify API interactions.
- **`user.css`**: CSS overrides to hide the default Spotify UI and style the SpoTUI interface.
- **`color.ini`**: Standard Spicetify color definitions.

## Features

- **Terminal Interface**: A command-driven overlay with a familiar feel.
- **Multiple Panels**:
    - **Lyrics**: Synced, auto-scrolling lyrics view.
    - **Playlists**: A two-pane view to browse playlists and their tracks.
    - **Help**: A quick reference for all available commands.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Control everything without touching the mouse.
- **Built-in Commands**: Manage playback, volume, playlists, and more.
- **Spotify Native Fallback**: Seamlessly switch back to the standard Spotify UI when needed.
